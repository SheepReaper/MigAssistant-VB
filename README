Just a note about the source to start with. It was built in Visual Studio 2010 beta 1 so it’s likely a requirement in order to open.

The Workstation Migration Assistant is a visual wrapper for Microsoft's User State Migration Tool, designed to simplify the capture / restore process for your end-users, and at the same time being highly configurable so that it can be customised to suit your organisations needs. Some of the features include:

•	Migrate via a pre-defined network storage location, external USB drive, or user-specified location. USB drive detection is automatic, and you can decide whether drives below a certain size are ignored (ie, memory sticks)
•	Optional Hard Disk Health Check will run a CHKDSK prior to capture and fix errors if any are found
•	Optional Encryption using a pre-defined company encryption key, or per-user customised encryption (for highly sensitive data that can’t be stored on a server without being encrypted)
•	Use different configurations for "XP Only" (2000 / XP to XP) migrations via Standard (2000 / XP / Vista / Win 7 to XP / Vista / Win 7)
•	Automatically run pre and post-capture / restore scripts and programs (very useful to further configure machine settings)
•	Migrate domain only accounts, or domain and local
•	Automatically exclude certain domain or local accounts from the migration
•	Automatically send log files to an e-mail address via SMTP after the migration
•	On-screen status during every stage of the migration, including ETA
•	Option to limit migrations to a certain size, i.e. if over 20GB of data to backup, then fail and inform user. This is also overridable
•	Automatic checks for USMT installation and optionally download and install
•	Command-line automation
•	Super-pretty UI :)

*** Pre-requisites ***

Please note that the Workstation Migration Assistant requires the Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 to function. If you don’t have it installed, you’ll receive an error when you try to run WMA

Installation and configuration

•	Extract the files to a local folder. It IS possible to run WMA from a network location, however this requires modifying the .NET security restrictions on each workstation you intend to run on. This can be done by running the following command from an Administrator Elevated command-prompt:

"C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\caspol" -quiet -m -ag "LocalIntranet_Zone" -url "\\UNCPATH\WMA\App\*" FullTrust -n "Workstation Migration Assistant Assembly" -d "Grants full trust"

Where \\UNCPATH\WMA\App is the full path to the Workstation Migration Assistant

•	Copy your USMT RuleSet files (MigUser.XML, MigApp.XML, MigSys.XML). If you do not have any, WMA will automatically copy these into the WMA folder on first run. Tailor them to suit your needs.

•	If required, generate a config file from your RuleSet files. This step is not required, but will speed up the initial scan time of a migration.  This is done by running:

ScanState.Exe /I:MigUser.XML /I:MigApp.XML /I:MigSys.XML /GenConfig:MyConfig.XML

Use the /TargetXP switch for XP Only migrations. This will speed up the migration process on these machine types.

•	Edit the Workstation Migration Assistant configuration file (MigAssistant.Exe.Config). The following options are available:

MigrationNetworkLocation
Location for Network-based Migrations

MigrationNetworkLocationDisabled
Whether Network-based Migrations are disabled

MigrationExclusionsDomain
Comma-delimited list of domain accounts to exclude

MigrationExclusionsLocal
Comma-delimited list of local accounts to exclude

MigrationExclusionsOlderThanDays
Specifies that the migration should exclude users that have not logged on within the specified time. The default value of 0 means this setting will be ignored

MigrationXPOnly
Whether migrations are "XP Only". XPOnly rules then apply, including /TargetXP switch in USMT

MigrationConfig
Default configuration file, created with ScanState /GenConfig: switch

MigrationConfigXPOnly
XP Only configuration file, created with ScanState /GenConfig: switch

MigrationMultiUserMode
If set, defaults the migration type to multi-user mode

MigrationRuleSet
Comma-delimited list of default ruleset files, ie. MigUser.XML, MigApp.XML, MigSys.XML

MigrationRuleSetXPOnly
Comma-delimited list of XP Only ruleset files, ie. MigUser.XML, MigApp.XML, MigSys.XML

MigrationUSBMinSize
Minimum size an attached USB drive needs to be before WMA will try to use for migration

MigrationUSBAutoUseIfAvailable
Automatically uses an attached USB drive if found, without prompting. Useful in ZTI scenarios

MigrationMaxSize
Maximum size of data allowed during capture process

MigrationOverWriteExistingFolders
Whether an existing migration should be automatically overwritten should it be found

MigrationCompressionDisabled
Disables compression (and encryption). This is useful for testing your ruleset to ensure everything is migrated

MigrationDomainChange
Whether users should be migrated to a new domain during LoadState

MigrationEncryptionDisabled
Whether encryption is enabled or disabled

MigrationEncryptionDefaultKey
The default encryption key to use in migrations

MigrationRestoreAccountsPassword
The password that should be set for accounts when multiple accounts are being migrated

MigrationRestoreAccountsEnabled
Whether accounts should be enabled when multiple accounts are being migrated

MigrationScriptsPreCapture
Comma-delimted list of scripts/executables to run pre-Capture

MigrationScriptsPostCapture
Comma-delimted list of scripts/executables to run post-Capture

MigrationScriptsPreRestore
Comma-delimted list of scripts/executables to run pre-Restore

MigrationScriptsPostRestore
Comma-delimted list of scripts/executables to run post-Restore

MigrationScriptsNoWindow
Whether output should be shown from these scripts

SettingsHealthCheckDefaultEnabled
Whether the Health Check should be enabled by default

SettingsWorkstationDetailsDisabled
Whether the Workstation Details panel should be disabled and hidden

SettingsAdvancedSettingsDisabled
Whether the Advanced Settings button and window show be disabled and hidden

MailSend
Whether an SMTP mail should be sent after capture / restore

MailServer
SMTP Server

MailRecipients
Comma-delimited list of e-mail recipients

MailFrom
Email address from which the mail should come from

USMTLoggingValue
Verbosity level for Scanstate / Loadstate. More info in USMT Help file (USMT.CHM)

SettingsDebugMode
Whether debugging is enabled / disabled. Debugging is outputted to the file %TEMP%\WMA.Log
